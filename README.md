Hello! This is a personal project developed during my third year in college. I tried to control Google Chrome dinossaur game using arduino. Sadly i don't have the fisical pieces anymore... However, i do have the code!

Basically i used a joystick connected on a circuit board. The arduino code output the joystick action (up or down), while the python code listen to it and activate the corresponding keyboard key.

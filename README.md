Hello! This is a personal project developed during my third year in college. I tried to control Google Chrome dinossaur game using arduino. Sadly i don't have the fisical pieces anymore... However, i do have the code!

Basically i used a joystick connected on a circuit board. The arduino code output the joystick action (up or down), while the python code listen to it and activate the corresponding keyboard key.

The arduino code was responsible to print the corresponding keyboard key.
